## Installation

This project utilizes the express and mongoose packages. I also used the nodemon dependency as well. 

## Usage

-An API for a social media site that uses a Mongoose database in order for my website to handle large amounts of unstructured data. 
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
